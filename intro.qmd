# Small Area Estimations for the poverty mapping: an overview

As discussed with Nobuo, Danielle and Eduard, place for an practitioners overview chapter.

Some overview ideas:

-   Make a decision tree of methodology given data availability.

-   Make a table to take a stock of methods and Corresponding R funciton/packages that implement it. For example, see @tbl-methods

| Methods         | `sae`          | `emdi` | `SUMMER`               |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|------------------------|
| Spatial Fay-Herriot      | `sae::mseFH()` |        | `SUMMER::smoothArea()` |
| FH Miltivariate |                |        |                        |
| Autocorrelation |                |        |                        |

Place figures under `images` and use them in the text as follows making sure to refer the sources correctly. For example, @fig-decission-tree is adapted from [@Corral2022, p. 5].

One can also embed mathematical formulas following the latex syntax: $y=a + b \log x$ . For more information, see [quarto help on authoring](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
