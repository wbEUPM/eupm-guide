# Data preparation

Introduction: this chapter provides a template for organizing the data flow in the EUPM analysis.

## Workflow and reproducibility principals

*   Brief overview of the data workflow between raw, auxiliary and clean data types.
*   Basic principles of reproducibility.

## Geospatial data

1.  Description of the basics of the GIS data preparation for countries at different admin levels. Key problems addressed.

1.  Spatial validity of polygons.
2.	Nested geospatial structure and non-intersecting boundaries.
3.	Polygon -unique identifiers.
4.	GIS boundaries harmonization over time.

    *   Synthetic regions aggregation constant in time
    
5.	Quality assurance of the administrative boundaries.

## Raw data search, collection, and documentation 

Description of the process of data search, collection and documentation that yields with a systematized, but unstructured data library 

1.  Variables search, and priority indicators.
2.  Key challenges and considerations for data inclusion:

    *   Thematic relevance
    *   Time range available
    *   Territorial unit available
    *   Coverage and completeness

3.  Details on specific data sources:

    *   API-based data
    *   Manually downloaded spreadsheets 
    *   Bulk downloads
    *   Remote sensing and GIS-based data, zonal statistcs, etc.

4.  Principals of data storage and systematization 
5.  Documenting collected data with metadata and it notes on search

    *   Key validation requirements â€“ source type, survey type
    
Country-based examples: use one country as an example. 

## Preparing auxiliary data

Adding structure to the raw data by transforming it into a normalized data set with columns: id, year, variable, value.

*   creating and storing the auxiliary data 
*   data reproduction and version-control 
*   principals of the data quality assurance and quality control

Country-based examples: use one country as an example. 

##  Clean and analysis-ready data

Getting meaningful and relevant indicators out of the data. 

*   Reshaping auxiliary data into the analysis-ready dataset.
*   Computing relevant indicators: means, ratios, fractions, etc.

    *   Group-wise operations by year, and across regions. 
    
*   Regression-data quality assurance: spatial and temporal completeness 
*   Adding data important data from elsewhere: SILK poverty estimates

## Descriptive analysis

Key principals and examples of descriptive statistics.

*   Examples of existing R functional for this.
